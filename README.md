## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `p1_retail_db`![library (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e1a949e-405c-4cab-bd2b-87521f06ebaf)


This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data analysis and want to build a solid foundation in SQL.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure


### 1. Database Setup
![ERD](https://github.com/kislaykumarjha82/Library-System-Management---P2-/blob/main/library_erd.png)


- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `p1_retail_db`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

2. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022**:
```sql
SELECT 
  *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    category = 'Clothing'
    AND 
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
    AND
    quantity >= 4
```

3. **Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) as net_sale,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
```

4. **Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.**:
```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(age), 2) as avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty'
```

5. **Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000
```

6. **Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    gender,
    COUNT(*) as total_trans
FROM retail_sales
GROUP 
    BY 
    category,
    gender
ORDER BY 1
```

7. **Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year**:
```sql
SELECT 
       year,
       month,
    avg_sale
FROM 
(    
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) as month,
    AVG(total_sale) as avg_sale,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) as rank
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
) as t1
WHERE rank = 1
```

8. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales **:
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) as total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5
```

9. **Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    category,    
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as cnt_unique_cs
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
```

10. **Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)**:
```sql
WITH hourly_sale
AS
(
SELECT *,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END as shift
FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT 
    shift,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders    
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift
```

Task 11. **Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE branch_reports
AS
SELECT 
    b.branch_id,
    b.manager_id,
    COUNT(ist.issued_id) as number_book_issued,
    COUNT(rs.return_id) as number_of_book_return,
    SUM(bk.rental_price) as total_revenue
FROM issued_status as ist

employees as e
ON e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
JOIN
branch as b
ON e.branch_id = b.branch_id
LEFT JOIN
return_status as rs
ON rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
JOIN 
books as bk
ON ist.issued_book_isbn = bk.isbn
GROUP BY 1, 2;

SELECT * FROM branch_reports;
```

**Task 16: CTAS: Create a Table of Active Members**  
Use the CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS) statement to create a new table active_members containing members who have issued at least one book in the last 2 months.

```sql

CREATE TABLE active_members
AS
SELECT * FROM members
WHERE member_id IN (SELECT 
                        DISTINCT issued_member_id   
                    FROM issued_status
                    WHERE 
                        issued_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 month'
                    )
;

SELECT * FROM active_members;

```


**Task 17: Find Employees with the Most Book Issues Processed**

GROUP BY 1, 2
```

**Task 18: Identify Members Issuing High-Risk Books**  
Write a query to identify members who have issued books more than twice with the status "damaged" in the books table. Display the member name, book title, and the number of times they've issued damaged books.    


**Task 19: Stored Procedure**
Objective:
Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system.
Description:
Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the library based on its issuance. The procedure should function as follows:
The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter.
The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes').
If the book is available, it should be issued, and the status in the books table should be updated to 'no'.
If the book is not available (status = 'no'), the procedure should return an error message indicating that the book is currently not available.

```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE issue_book(p_issued_id VARCHAR(10), p_issued_member_id VARCHAR(30), p_issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(30), p_issued_emp_id VARCHAR(10))
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$

DECLARE
-- all the variabable
    v_status VARCHAR(10);

BEGIN
-- all the code
    -- checking if book is available 'yes'
    SELECT 
        status 
        INTO
        v_status
    FROM books
    WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

    IF v_status = 'yes' THEN

        INSERT INTO issued_status(issued_id, issued_member_id, issued_date, issued_book_isbn, issued_emp_id)
        VALUES
        (p_issued_id, p_issued_member_id, CURRENT_DATE, p_issued_book_isbn, p_issued_emp_id);

        UPDATE books
            SET status = 'no'
        WHERE isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

        RAISE NOTICE 'Book records added successfully for book isbn : %', p_issued_book_isbn;


    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE 'Sorry to inform you the book you have requested is unavailable book_isbn: %', p_issued_book_isbn;
    END IF;
END;
$$

-- Testing The function
SELECT * FROM books;
-- "978-0-553-29698-2" -- yes
-- "978-0-375-41398-8" -- no
SELECT * FROM issued_status;

CALL issue_book('IS155', 'C108', '978-0-553-29698-2', 'E104');
CALL issue_book('IS156', 'C108', '978-0-375-41398-8', 'E104');

SELECT * FROM books
WHERE isbn = '978-0-375-41398-8'

```



**Task 20: Create Table As Select (CTAS)**
